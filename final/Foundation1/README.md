# YouTube Videos and Comments Tracking Program

## Description

This program demonstrates the principle of abstraction by simulating a system to track YouTube videos and comments. The purpose of this program is to illustrate how classes can be used to encapsulate data and provide a clean interface for interacting with that data.

## Program Specification

The program uses three classes:

1. `Video`: Represents a YouTube video and stores information such as the title, author, and length (in seconds) of the video. It also keeps track of a list of comments associated with the video.

2. `Comment`: Represents a comment left on a YouTube video and stores information about the commenter's name and the text of the comment.

3. `Program`: Contains the main method and is responsible for creating video objects, adding comments to the videos, and displaying the information for each video along with its comments.

## Usage

1. Compile the C# program using a C# compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports C#.

2. Run the compiled executable to execute the program.

3. The program will display a list of YouTube videos and comments. Each video will show its title, author, length, the number of comments, and the list of comments with the commenter's name and the comment text.
